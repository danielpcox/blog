# blog

What I really want is a blog where each post is a Jupyter notebook (preferably interactive). This suddenly seems within reach. People involved with the Jupyter project have recently created an easy way to launch interactive notebooks hosted on GitHub, called [Binder](https://mybinder.org). So this is the plan for the moment: I'll post chit-chat at [danielpcox.postach.io](danielpcox.postach.io), and [link to an interactive Jupyter notebook hosted by Binder](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/danielpcox-blog-v2chcslj/notebooks/2018/0928_code-for-blog-posts.ipynb).

How cool is that?
