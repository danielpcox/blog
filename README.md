# blog

What I really want is a blog where each post is a Jupyter notebook (preferably interactive). This suddenly seems within reach. People involved with the Jupyter project have recently created an easy way to launch interactive notebooks hosted on GitHub, called [Binder](https://mybinder.org). So this is the plan for the moment: I'll post chit-chat at [danielpcox.postach.io](https://danielpcox.postach.io), and [link directly to the notebook](https://github.com/danielpcox/blog/blob/master/2018/0928_code-for-blog-posts.ipynb). If you'd like to play along, you can use Binder.
